# TODO: Fix CORS Error and Profile Update Issue

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Identified root cause: `localStorage.setItem` in backend controller causing server error
- [x] Removed invalid `localStorage.setItem` line from `backend/src/controllers/userController.js`
- [x] Committed changes to git with descriptive message

## Next Steps
- [ ] Deploy backend changes to production (excel-analytics-platform-cdyj.onrender.com)
- [ ] Test profile update functionality on frontend (excel-sathi.netlify.app)
- [ ] Verify CORS headers are present in API responses
- [ ] Check that environment variables are correctly set:
  - Backend: `FRONTEND_URL` (should be `https://excel-sathi.netlify.app`)
  - Frontend: `VITE_API_URL` (should be `https://excel-analytics-platform-cdyj.onrender.com`)

## Notes
- CORS is already configured in `server.js` with correct origin
- Frontend correctly handles localStorage updates after receiving response
- The fix should resolve both the CORS error and the "failed to update profile" issue
